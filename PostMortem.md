What worked well for your team?  
We worked well in every partition of our project. We successfully added the required calculation functions, we made it throught the tests, and we finished it on time

What did not work well for your team and how will you address this for assignment 3 and the final project.  
Everything worked fine, but there is just one thing to notice: for operators like sin and x^2, the input form is like 2sin, which means sin(2)
